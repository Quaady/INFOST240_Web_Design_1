    <p> Wages climbed briskly in June and employers continued their hiring spree, the latest evidence that the labor market remains strong even as the Federal Reserve tries to cool the economy and contain inflation.

At the same time, average hourly earnings picked up by 5.1 percent in the year through June, down slightly from 5.3 percent in the year through May. Economists in a Bloomberg survey

       a type of crime that is extremely rare in a country with some of the most stringent laws on buying and owning firearms.
