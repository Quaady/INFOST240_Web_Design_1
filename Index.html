    <h1> HERE'S MY INTRODUCTION </h1>

    <p>Title's Called <strong>"Field Trip to Seattle"</strong></p>
    <p> This is actually the first time I have a proper a equipment to vlog and it was early 2021 when *cough* covid was still a popular issue (still is really).
        This is also the time where I started to jump into the vlogger bandwagon eventhough I think I was quite late for that but I still made the jump, since 
        I wanted to express myself more and find it as a side hobby afterwards, video haven't had any subtitle to it since the beginning since I intended it to 
        be made and consume by fellow Indonesian who doesn't had the experience studying or just travelling abroad due to plenty of reasons, and hence why I made
        this video. </p>

    <p> At first I was hesitant about it,</p>
    <p> Coming from studying a lot of Social Science stuff when I was in Highschool (History, Economic, Geography, you'll get it), and at the time highschool me 
        wasn't quite the time I enjoy how I lived my life, Yes I do have that highschool life after school (doing what highschoolers do for the most part). 
        However I just wasn't ready to face reality that I had to pursue a <strong>Law Degree</strong> (because that is what usually strict Asian Parent wants their children do for a living)
        when I got into college. However an incident hit me and made me realize that I think I can do more than just reading law books and memorizing them. 
        At my second year in Highschool I got a chance to partake a competition for one of a good private college school back in my country that is well known for their Business,
        Marketing schools, essentially a goto private school if you wanted to plunge deep into the business or related sector, me and my friends took part in that competition, that 
        some how change my life trajectory and land me into this field, knowing that what I won was a <strong>Digital Marketing Competition</strong> case. Since my Country doesn't allow people
        who major in the social science since Highschool to take any science related field in college I decided to go abroad to study what now become my major Computer Science, how I manage to 
        struck a deal with my parents are quite the feet, since I had to prove how worthy I am to even change my major, working my butts off 24/7 when I was in highschool was indeed the pain.
        But if it means to make somewhat my life to had a meaning is something else. Timeskip to today, I finished my Associate degree got a transfer degree to UWM, got a lot of friends from around
        the globe.
